### Welcome to my GitHub Profile

My name is Wayne Lambert and I live in Birmingham, UK. Please accept my socially distanced greeting during these strange times. :punch: :smiley:

I'm passionate about web development with Django and Python. I also enjoy analysing datasets with Python Data Science libraries, travelling, and reading.
